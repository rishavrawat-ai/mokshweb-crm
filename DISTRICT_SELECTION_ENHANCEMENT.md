## 🎯 NEW FEATURES

I have upgraded the district selection UI in the Campaign Manager.

### 1. 🗂️ Enhanced Card UI
- Districts now appear in a polished card with a blue gradient header.
- Shows total district count in a badge.

### 2. 🔍 Search Districts
- Added a dedicated search box inside the card.
- You can now type to filter the district list instantly.
- Handy for states with many districts (like UP).

### 3. 📜 Scrollable List
- Replaced the grid with a clean, vertical scrollable list.
- Fixed height (`max-h-80`) keeps the UI tidy even with 50+ districts.
- Each item shows the location count and a nice hover effect.

## 🎨 USER EXPERIENCE IMPROVEMENTS

**Before**:
- Simple grid of buttons.
- Hard to find specific districts if the list was long.
- Took up too much vertical space.

**After**:
- **Searchable**: Find "Agra" instantly.
- **Compact**: Scrollable area saves space.
- **Informative**: Clearer location counts and icons.
- **Professional**: Looks like a modern dashboard component.

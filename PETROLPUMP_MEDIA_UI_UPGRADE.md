## 🎯 UPDATED: State & City List Component

I have upgraded the **States** list on the Petrolpump Media page (public site) as per your request.

### 🌟 New Features

1.  **🔍 Search Inside Card**:
    - When you click a State (e.g., "UP"), a **search bar** now appears at the top of the list.
    - You can type "Agra" or "Lucknow" to instantly filter the list.

2.  **📜 Scrollable List**:
    - The list is now **scrollable** with a fixed height.
    - No more super long pages! The card stays a manageable size even with 50+ districts.

3.  **✨ Improved Card Design**:
    - Cleaner styling for the State header.
    - Better hover effects.
    - Smooth expansion animation.
